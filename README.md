# Vocabularize

This is a very simple dictionary created with react + [dictionary](https://dictionaryapi.dev/).

## What I've learned in this project

I learned how to make a dark mode and style the dark mode button. I was planning to make an autocomplete search in this project but it seems that I can only fetch data for each word using this API. This project also established what I've learnt in React.
